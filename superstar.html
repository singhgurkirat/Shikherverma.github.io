		When the universe is not a sphere but a screen with a perfect frame,
		<br>
		When that click possess umbrae of emotions,
		<br>
		When he is not a superstar but the best in his knack.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Superstar, the title that says it all, when the being is just a successful performer, showcasing his knack around. Going inside	the backdrop picture, when the photographer narrates its better	clicks, he believes that every frame he captures holds a series of moments forming a story depicted in a single shot. Every being holding a camera is not a photographer, but a being with a perception of capturing the moments.
		</p>
		<p>
		So, if anybody is searching photography as a hobby, Photo-Walks	can be an option as it serves as a perfect lesson and Random Clicks that works as a submission for examination.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Superstar was asked about his hobby and passion. He finds his passion, his heart, his mind, all in is clicks. When every screen	for him is meant to be inside his glass lens, when falling in love is falling for his tangible emotions.
		</p>
		<p>
		So getting into the conversation one last question was if our superstar was perfect?
		</p>
		<p>
		He believe that apart from being passionate, he is still on his	first step of journey and would love to search one step lesser than last. The artist that would love to end as a learner.
		</p>
		<p>
		Yes, The Superstar, The Super Performer, The Photographer...
