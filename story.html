		When some routes don’t match, Let it Go,
		<br>
		When worlds don’t wear the old colour, Let it Go,
		<br>
		When the contrast don’t work, Let it Go.
		<br>
		All the things we learn from life, the best part is that it goes on, and it happens because we let it go, we let the things moving. <br>
		Let the irritation go, let the things that make you cry go, go deep in or remain shallow, shallow as the paint, but if it goes let it dive deep as the colour.<br>
		Life which is independent of the pendulum, the almighty that predicts every tick, which keeps on going. The motion is the most important element, so sometimes every dish don’t suits the plate, sometimes things don’t work according to the requirement, but that doesn’t prove the motion false, Let it go. Things carry two contrasting images, Correct or incorrect. Incorrect is not something that holds errors as mistakes but as being judged, incorrect is something that don’t suits the taste. When things don’t work accordingly, folks find it incorrect. But, ‘The Let it Go’ movement could make you free, free of expectations, free of frustrations, free from the thread of over thinking. And what if it would actually revamp the incorrect to correct. <br>
		It is the expression of freedom which the soul needs, the need to let peace settle down in you, the form where the serenity meets inside you, whilst you, keep a check on you. It keeps you in the real world which you are meant to face.<br>
