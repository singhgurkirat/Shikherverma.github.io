		The world stops, the clock stays, another soul leaves a body, and another child leaves his parent, that too forever. The world is so full of happiness, colors and beautiful souls. At small ages where people could make girlfriends, get part time jobs, pursue their hobbies again, they find giving their life away as a better option. Is stress making them dull? is the tension of passing an exam making a student take his life?<br>
		If they have reached here, why can't they say rest is easy? If they made their parents proud in some annual function 10 years, it is easier now. Why is the level of meeting expectations so high that they can't live with contentment?
		Parents should know their child will become something one day, if he has the right morals, not the perfect college or degree or even highest marks are necessary, just their support in what he really wants to do. <br>

		LET the child know he is going to be fine one day, with all hustle and competitions. You should know to take your life day by day, never thinking about how you could get flunked rather working upon to get better. Better at work. Go and smile at a stranger, let a child hold your finger in his fist, make tea for your family, love your partner more every day, eat chocolates, study hard, work smart, have faith. <br>

		For people, it is not the negativity around, it lies within. The negative energy surrounds the being because of the failure they carry along. The problem is because our mind is still not accepting. The trouble is that the failure is still not given its place in heart. But suicide is not the end, as there is always a fair chance that life will give us more opportunities. Life is full of surprises, so it doesn't matter if sometimes the surprises are not on the same track we like. Just hope, hope for the positives, wait for the right time, because things will certainly change, and the clock will be in the right hand because it is just a matter of time.<br>

		Let the little things in life make you happy, embrace the tiny, to gain the bigger. If you fail, make efforts to pass, change the perspective or change the job.  There is something great instore for you, do not give up but put a smile, take your life day by day, breathe by breathe. <br>


		"Laugh with friends, work because you want to gain, have faith to receive, which is how you will rise to be a better human being"   <br>


		Let's make the world smile for once.  <br>
