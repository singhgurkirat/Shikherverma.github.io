		The beauty that reflects the picture,<br> 
		The beauty that narrates the self,<br>
		The beauty that is inside…<br>
		Every morning the mirror on the wall revert back an image, an outline that is you. This reflector creates the form, the color, but does it express the story inside?<br>
		The people around you judge your expressions, personality, features, but are they the appropriate ones to decide the score?
		 Beauty is not about fair complexion or flat stomach, it’s the values, the culture that is born along you. The inside beauty is the new trend. So, now it is the time to come out and gel with this new trend. The soul inside needs a judge, a judge to score. But the appropriate candidate for this is you, yourself, the being that could rate perfectly and could encourage for improvement. <br>
		The skin you hold is perfect, the layers you carry is a gift that makes you special, important, and unique. So, let go the troubles you carry, let go the words in the air, just love the way you be, love the way you love yourself, love the skin you carry.<br>
