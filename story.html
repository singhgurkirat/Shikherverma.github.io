		ORIGIN
		</p>
		<p>	
		The start for the minutes to evolve,
		</p>
		<p>
		The birth of the micro form,
		</p>
		<p>
		The first picture of the future.
		</p>
		<p>
		Origin, a word too short, but holds the power of evolution, holds the strength to revamp. The origin works as beginning for	everything, the first breath of the soul. It acts as the source of creation, further growing to hold the worth, get the nomenclature.
		</p>
		<p>
		And what if the origin still lies in the tome of mystery. What if the birth, the creation still compete in the hide and seek.
		</p>
		<p>
		The origin is just a teeny form that is unaware of the colossal
		form that is yet to come and hence, the game of mystery is always on.
		</p>
		<p>
		Origin is the threshold, a unit that awaits for the upcoming reactions. It is the first moment that awaits to pinion in a story	and then the clock counts the first tick. But this clock does'nt hold a past, the clock that runs onto present and future. Origin that begins with the one minute after because the one minute before does'nt exist.
		</p>
		<p>
		Origin is the winsome moment, it is the start and never looking	back. When a part starts the journey, it never goes back to its	place. Origin lies underneath the expression to kick off from a	point. The moment of cherishing the discovery of NEW.
