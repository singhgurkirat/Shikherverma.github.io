					Silence, the voice of the inside,
					</p>
					<p>	
					Silence, the emotion flowing through the arteries,
					</p>
					<p>
					Silence, the soul is searching for...
					</p>
					<p>
					The silence is the loudest voice, the voice that is inside every being. It is the voice of the ideas, the passion that every being holds, or the voice of itself. This silence defines the entity for that being.
					</p>
					<p>
					The idea of the blog is to build a platform for every being to present their knack in front of the world. The silence is the strength for every action. It builds a fighter in every soul making it eternal. The silence owns a heart of hope, many hearts, and many hopes. Alone and lost a heart sit aside, hearing the tone of the vibrations, the noise of the clement wind. The silence feels a note in every noise, the noise making euphony. The silence stands in a hope of new soul understanding the quintessence of the euphony.
					</p>
					<p>
					For once, if the silence owns a voice, just as the soul owns a heart. The soul is an entity without the body but only a heart that could pump out through the invisible being.
					</p>
					<p>
					The idea of this block is to create a platform for every being to portray the art they possess. In this section the people can post any of the art work they feel they are good at. This block welcome all art forms like music, caricatures, painting, photography, video making, cooking, social work, etc., any sort of work they are good at. This block is for the folks who had somewhere met their inner self but and are waiting for the self to meet the world, waiting for the self to teach the world, HUMANITY. This is for the people who evolved their new ideas, who work on the observations, who approach the new directions.
					</p>
					<p>
					The main section is where the people can post their work and let the world see it, they can post all their art forms.
